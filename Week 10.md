### Problem 1:

------

Mr David is playing a word-linking game. In this game, a word is considered to be linked to the previous word if at least one letter at the beginning of the word matches the last letter of the previous word. Create a program that can take two words as input and determine whether these two words can be used in the word-linking game. If they can, the program should also display the longest subword that can link the two given words.

Example 1:
`Length of the first word: 8`
`First word: accuracy`
`Length of the second word: 8`
`Second word: cylinder`
`Both words can be linked with the subword 'cy'.`

Example 2:
`Length of the first word: 7`
`First word: physics`
`Length of the second word: 9`
`Second word: chemistry`
`Both words cannot be linked.`



### Problem 2: 

------

Mrs Jane considers a number to be "beautiful" if all its digits are the same and not equal to zero (e.g., 333, 5, 44). Given a number x that is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 5 (in other words, relatively prime with 10), create a program that takes input x and returns the smallest beautiful number that is divisible by x.

Example 1: 

`Input x: 7` 

`The smallest beautiful number divisible by 7 is 7.`

Example 2: 

`Input x: 13` 

`The smallest beautiful number divisible by 13 is 111111.`

Example 3: 

`Input x: 259` 

`The smallest beautiful number divisible by 259 is 777.`
